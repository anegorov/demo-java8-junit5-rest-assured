#### What was done:
1. Based on provided specification I created mocks. Used that resource mocklab.io. Pretty good I have to say. So that gave me ability to emulate real responses.
2. Create one positive and 4 negative tests

#### Used technologies
* JUnit5
* REST Assured
* Allure
* AssertJ
* TypeSafe
* Lombok

#### To run tests locally
